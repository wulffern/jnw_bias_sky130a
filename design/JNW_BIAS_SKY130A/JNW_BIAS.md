Generates a current that is proportional to absolute temperature.

The OTA is used to copy VD1 to VR1. The difference between VR1 (VD1) and VD2
will be given by 

$$ \Delta V_D = \frac{kT}{q} ln( 8 \times 8)$$

,where the first factor 8 comes from the current mirror scaling, and the second
factor of 8 comes from the bipolar size difference.
